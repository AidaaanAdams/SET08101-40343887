		<p><span>It's 2026 and you're living in LA. The COVID-19 disease has been about for the last 6 years, just when things looked like they were getting better... They got worse.<br>
		The disease has mutated heavily and started to change the inner workings of our DNA. Suddenly all those who previously died to this disease are coming back from the dead, there is only one thing they want.<br>
		To kill and eat every last living human on the planet!<br>
		Your goal is to escape the city and make it to safety... Good luck!<br>
		You'll need it!</p></span>
