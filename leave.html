		<p><span>You thank the man for his help and leave the shop into the streets, your plan is to find a vehicle and escape the city and hopefully the zombies. As you are walking down the street a zombie runs out of an alley towards you. Wit your new guns you think you are invincible. You shoot the zombie without thinking... The gunshot alerts all of the zombies of your position, they quickly swarm you.</p></span>
