		<p><span>You enter the dark supermarket with only a flashlight, you navigate round the isles looking for supplies to help you survive. You go through to the warehouse at the back as the supermarket has already been raided. As you enter the warehouse you knock over a metal pole, the sound echos through the whole shop. Before you knew it zombies were swarming towards you. You had no escape...</p></span>
		
		<h3><span>You didnt make it out of that supermarket... YOU DIED!</span></h3>
